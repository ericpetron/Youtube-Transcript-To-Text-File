# Youtube-Transcript-To-Text-File
** THIS IS VERY UNFINISHED **
** MORE DOCUMENTATION WILL COME **


This is a python script that uses selenium and navigates the web elements on page and take the transcript from a Youtube video and puts it into a text file.

Python is a requirement to run this you can find the Python download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The setup file called 'setup_yt2tran.py' if ran will automatically install the dependancies and the onlt other external download needed is the geckodriver for firefox. Which can be found here https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Once you have all of the dependancies it should work. This script is still very buggy so if it does crash run it a few times and if it doesn't work than put it under the 'Issues' part on this github.
