# Youtube-Transcript-To-Text-File
** THIS IS VERY UNFINISHED **
** MORE DOCUMENTATION WILL COME **


This is a python script that uses selenium and navigates the web elements on page and take the transcript from a Youtube video and puts it into a text file.

Python is a requirement to run this you can find the Python download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

A requirement for this to work is the Selenium Framework. This allows the python I wrote to interact with webpages. For install instructions they are posted here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

The final thing you will have to download for this to work are the most recent geckodriver (for firefox) and that github page can be found here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Once you have all of the dependancies it should work. This script is still very buggy so if it does crash run it a few times and if it doesn't work than put it under the 'Issues' part on this github.
